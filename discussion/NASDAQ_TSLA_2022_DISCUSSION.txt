Code or otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction.
SECTION 2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans
made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender under the Facility to
make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender under the Facility of its obligations hereunder; provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans
as required.

bearing interest at the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate. Each Lender at its option may make any Loan by causing any domestic or foreign

the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) any such domestic or foreign branch or
Affiliate of such Lender shall not be entitled to request compensation under Section 2.14 at the time such Loan is made.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any Term Benchmark Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be

multiple of €1,000,000 and not less than €10,000,000). At the time that each ABR Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in

Facility does not exceed $7,000,000,000. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase to be provided by one or more Lenders
with a Commitment in the Facility (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, an “Increasing Lender”; it being
understood and agreed that each Lender of the Facility approached to provide any such increase shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to provide such increase), or by one or more banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such bank, financial
institution or other entity, an “Augmenting Lender”), to increase their existing Commitments in respect of the Facility, or extend
Commitments in respect of the Facility, as the case may be; provided that (i) each Augmenting Lender, shall be subject to the
approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (ii) (x) in the case of an
Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto
and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the
form of Exhibit D hereto. Increases and new Commitments created pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall become effective on the
date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Lenders with a Commitment in the Facility and the
Administrative Agent shall notify each affected Lender thereof; provided that no increase in the Commitments created pursuant to
this paragraph (e) shall become effective less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the

unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase, the conditions set forth in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) shall be
satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders with a Commitment in the Facility and the Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower and (ii) the Administrative Agent

Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments of the
Facility, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender with a Commitment in the Facility and Augmenting Lender with a Commitment in the
Facility shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent
shall determine, for the benefit of the other relevant Lenders in the Facility, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect
to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other relevant Lenders in the Facility, each Lender’s
portion of the outstanding Loans under the Facility of all the Lenders with Commitments in the Facility to equal its Applicable
Percentage of such outstanding Loans under the Facility, (ii) the Lenders shall purchase and assume (without recourse or warranty)
from the Lenders undivided participation interests in any outstanding LC Exposure to the extent necessary to ensure that after
giving effect to any such increase in the Commitments of the Facility, each Lender has outstanding Loans and participation
interests in outstanding LC Exposure equal to its Applicable Percentage and (iii) the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and
re-borrowed all outstanding Loans of the Facility as of the date of any increase in the Commitments of the Facility (with such re-
borrowing to consist of the Types of Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the
Borrower in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (iii) of the

reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and each relevant Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the
Availability Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of any Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no Issuing Bank shall have any obligation hereunder to issue, and shall not issue, any Letter of Credit the
proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (i) to fund any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in
any Sanctioned Country, (ii) in any manner that would result in a violation of any Sanctions by any party to this Agreement or (iii) in
any manner that would result in a violation of one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally. An
Issuing Bank shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental

Effective Date (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder). No Issuing Bank shall have any obligation
hereunder to issue any Letter of Credit other than a standby Letter of Credit, unless such Issuing Bank shall so agree.
(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter
of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy

Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension, but in any event no less than three (3) Business Days) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying (A) the date of issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension (which shall be a Business Day), (B) the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
Section 2.04(c)), (C) the Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, (D) the Borrower as the account party and, if desired by the

such Letter of Credit issuance, the Borrower shall have entered into a continuing agreement (or other letter of credit agreement)
for the issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the applicable
Issuing Bank and using such bank’s standard form (each, a “Letter of Credit Agreement”). A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower
shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after
40
giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) (x) the aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of
Credit issued by an Issuing Bank at such time, plus (y) the aggregate amount of all LC Disbursements made by such Issuing Bank
that have not yet been reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower at such time shall not exceed its Letter of Credit Commitment,
(ii) the LC Exposure shall not exceed the total Letter of Credit Commitments, (iii) no Lender’s Credit Exposure shall exceed its
Commitment and (iv) the Total Credit Exposure shall not exceed the total Commitments. The Borrower may, at any time and from

conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above shall not be satisfied.
(c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination by notice from an Issuing
Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one (1) year after the date of the
issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year after the then-current expiration date
at the time of such renewal or extension) and (ii) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date; provided that
any Letter of Credit with a one-year tenor may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no
event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii)).
(d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, such Issuing Bank hereby
grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to
such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration
and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by such Issuing
Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.04(e), or of any reimbursement payment
required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations pursuant to this paragraph (d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and
continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars such LC Disbursement, calculated
as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the first (1st)
Business Day immediately following the date that such LC Disbursement is made; provided that, if such LC Disbursement is not less
than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section
2.03 that such payment be financed with a Dollar denominated ABR Loan on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an
amount equal to the amount of such drawing and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation to make such payment shall
be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in
respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay
to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided
in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the
41
amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the
Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or,
to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph (e) to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank, then to
such Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this
paragraph (e) to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Loans as contemplated above)
shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
(f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section
2.04(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document
presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue
or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether
or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.04, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders nor the Issuing Banks, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder
(irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay
in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from
causes beyond the control of the Issuing Banks. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-
appealable ruling), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on
their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, each Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either
accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
(g) Disbursement Procedures. Each Issuing Bank shall, within the period stipulated by terms and conditions of
the applicable Letter of Credit, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit.
The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telecopy or electronic mail of such
demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any
failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the
Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest,
for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the reimbursement is due
and payable at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC
Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.04(e), then Section 2.12(e) shall apply. Interest accrued
42
pursuant to this paragraph (h) shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the
date of payment by any Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(e) to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender
to the extent of such payment.
(i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. (i) An Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement
among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative
Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become
effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b).
From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of
Issuing Banks under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (y) references herein to the term
“Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Banks, or to such successor and all previous
Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with
respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank may resign as an
Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the
Lenders, in which case, such Issuing Bank shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.06(i) above.
(j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the
Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph (j), the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date, plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective
immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or (i). Such deposit shall be held by
the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.
The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole
discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower’s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse any Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent
not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time
or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of
cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid)
shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
(k) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or
outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, or states that a Subsidiary is the “account
party,” “applicant,” “customer,” “instructing party,”
