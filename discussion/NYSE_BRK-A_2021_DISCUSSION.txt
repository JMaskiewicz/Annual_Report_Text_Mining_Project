The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to
date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses
declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and
continuingin2021,manyofthesebusinessesexperiencedsignificantrecoveriesinrevenuesandearnings,insomeinstances
exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain
disruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to
higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our
operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of
consumersandbusinessesweserve.

from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of
approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were
favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts.
Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback
program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance
business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the
GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss

After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020
compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per
car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020
reflectedlowerrailroadoperatingrevenuesfromlowershippingvolumes,attributabletothenegativeeffectsoftheCOVID-

utilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The

Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our
investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that
investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of
equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the
economicperformanceofouroperatingbusinesses.Thesegainsandlosseshavecausedandwillcontinuetocausesignificant

Insurance—Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of
Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we
evaluateperformanceofunderwritingoperationswithoutanyallocationofinvestmentincomeorinvestmentgainsandlosses.

GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims
frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims
frequenciesweresignificantlybelowhistoricallevelsfromtheeffectsoflessdrivingbypolicyholdersduringtheCOVID-19

GEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies or

$526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the
effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity
liabilitieswere$15.1billionatDecember31,2021andhadaweightedaveragediscountrateofapproximately3.9%.
Variableannuity
Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18
million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities
markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of
expected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net
effectsofinterestratechangesand,toalesserextent,changesinsecuritiesmarkets.

Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5%
decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge
revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the

Industrialproducts
The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision
Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC
InternationalMetalworkingCompanies(“IMC”)),andMarmon,whichconsistsofmorethan100autonomousmanufacturing

and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and
LiquidPowerSpecialtyProducts).
2021versus2020
Revenuesoftheindustrialproductsgroupin2021increased$2.5billion(9.8%)from2020.Pre-taxearningsincreased
$714million(19.0%)comparedto2020andpre-taxearningsasapercentageofrevenuesin2021was15.9%,anincreaseof
1.3percentagepointscompared2020.
PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC
has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material
declines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020.
WhilecommercialairtravelincreasedinboththeU.S.andinternationalmarketsin2021versus2020,demandremainswell
below pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and
strong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air traffic
recoverywillcontinuetobeimpactedbythepandemic,thoughlikelymoreonaseasonalorlocalizedbasisasthepandemic
shifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished
goodsinventoryfollowingqualityissueswiththeBoeing737andBoeing787planesandindustrysupplychainissues.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the
actions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for
PCC’s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospace
revenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’s
significantinventorylevelsandtheongoingimpactoftheCOVID-19pandemiconcommercialairtravel.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher
average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher
volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021,
which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the
secondhalfof2021.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses
related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and
impairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product
lines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the
effects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production
facilities,whichresultedinlostsalesandincrementalmanufacturingcosts.

PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19
pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the
pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant
reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers.
Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the

attributabletolowervolumesfromeconomiceffectsofthepandemicandafireatanAdditivesmanufacturing,blendingand

operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s
consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered
Materialsproductlines,partlyoffsetbyhighervolumesinLifeScienceproducts.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The
effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by
loweraveragerawmaterialcosts,loweroperatingexpensesandinsurancerecoveriesin2020associatedwiththeRouenfire.

effectsofbusinessacquisitions,revenuesdecreasedinessentiallyallgroups,primarilyattributabletolowerdemandfromthe
effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies
groups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business
divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and
Crane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’s
Medicalgroup.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the
declines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower
productdemand,particularlyinthesectorsmostimpactedbythepandemic.

During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various
forms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material and

Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%)

Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted
in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending
patternsduring2020.Theseverityanddurationoftheeffectsfromthepandemicvariedwidelyatourretailoperations.
BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and
pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were
essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020,
attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year.
However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected
saleslevels.
The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies and

McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food
consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operates
businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservice
businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including
Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021
with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could

Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and
BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and
losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period
can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.

Ourconsolidatedclaimliabilities,includingliabilitiesfromretroactivereinsurancecontracts,asofDecember31,2021
were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.
Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid
lossesofthesebusinessesfollows.
GEICO
GEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaid
losses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving
methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability
estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a
combinationofseveralactuarialestimationmethods,includingBornhuetter-Fergusonandchain-laddermethodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and
personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development
estimates. As of December31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. We
selectcasedevelopmentfactorsthroughanalysisoftheoveralladequacyofhistoricalcaseliabilities.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims
expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age
projectionsoftheultimatecountsbyquarterlyaccidentperiod,fromwhichwedeductreportedclaimstoproducethenumber
of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim
counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are
difficulttoapply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure
models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a
givenperiodandprojectstheultimatecost.
Ourclaimliabilityestimatesrecordedattheendof2020werereducedby$1.8billionduring2021,whichproduceda

Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages

of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances,
weallocatelossestopropertyandcasualtycoveragesbasedoninternalestimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information
received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms.
Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than
primaryinsurancepolicies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess
contractsmaybecomparabletotheinformationreceivedunderaprimaryinsurancecontract.However,lossinformationwith
respecttoaggregateexcess-of-lossandquota-sharecontractsisofteninasummaryformatratherthanonanindividualclaim
basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide
reliableIBNRlossestimates.
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is
generallyrequiredatquarterlyintervalsrangingfrom30to90daysaftertheendofthequarterlyperiod,whileoutsideofthe
U.S.,reinsurancereportingpracticesmayvaryfurther.Incertaincountries,clientsreportannuallyfrom90to180daysafter
the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further
delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the
type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance
coverage,andforotherreasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so
there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain
certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms.
Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business,
thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise
concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation
with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution
processes.Therearenocoveragedisputesatthistimeforwhichanadverseresolutionwouldlikelyhaveamaterialimpacton

estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation
claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may
causeustoadjustourcaseestimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry
data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and
management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling

Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the
paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain
catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our
processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of

the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-

The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding
amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were
approximately $2.1 billion at December31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the
changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new

Retroactivereinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the
claim-tailstobeverylong.AsofDecember31,2021,grossunpaidlosseswere$38.3billionanddeferredchargeswere$10.6
billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that
maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significant
judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it
unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated
grossliability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing
ourliabilityestimates,weoftenanalyzehistoricalaggregatelosspaymentpatternsandprojectexpectedultimatelossesunder
various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We
then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information
concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant
deviationsfromexpectedresultsarerevealed.
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our

respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying

In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception
represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize
deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of
losspayments.Wealsoadjustdeferredchargebalancesduetochangesintheexpectedtimingandultimateamountofclaim

include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and
other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in
performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and
earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the

Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by
assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as other
assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict.
Consequently,anyfairvalueestimatesinsuchinstancescanbesubjecttowidevariations.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key
assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital
expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in
estimatingthefairvalueofareportingunitandinperforminggoodwillimpairmenttests.

Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the
carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these
amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19
pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several
factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand,
employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions we
