BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Business
We are a financial holding company headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida, and we are the parent of our wholly owned subsidiary,
Capital City Bank (the “Bank” or “CCB”). We provide a full range of banking services, including traditional deposit and credit
services, mortgage banking, asset management, trust, merchant services, bankcards, securities brokerage services and financial
advisory services, including the sale of life insurance, risk management, and asset protection services. The Bank has 58 banking
offices and 89 ATMs/ITMs in Florida, Georgia and Alabama. Through Capital City Home Loans, LLC (“CCHL”), we have 33
additional offices in the Southeast for our mortgage banking business. Please see the section captioned “About Us” beginning on
page 4 for more detailed information about our business.
Our profitability, like most financial institutions, is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income, which is the difference
between the interest and fees received on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest paid on interest-
bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses,
operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy , and other operating expenses including income taxes, and
noninterest income such as mortgage banking revenues, wealth management fees, deposit fees, and bank card fees.
Strategic Review
Operating Philosophy. Our philosophy is to build long-term client relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards,
and safe and sound banking practices. We maintain a locally oriented, community-based focus, which is augmented by
experienced, centralized support in select specialized areas. Our local market orientation is reflected in our network of banking
office locations, experienced community executives with a dedicated President for each market, and community boards which
support our focus on responding to local banking needs. We strive to offer a broad array of sophisticated products and to provide
quality service by empowering associates to make decisions in their local markets.
36
Strategic Initiatives. In 2021, we initiated a new five-year strategic plan “2025 In Focus” that will guide us in the areas of client
experience, channel optimization, market expansion, and culture. As part of 2025 In Focus, we aim to take our brand of
relationship banking to the next level, further deepen relationships within our communities, expand into new higher growth
markets, diversify our revenue sources, invest in new technology that will support the expansion of client relationships, scale
within our lines of business, and drive higher profitability. In 2022, we implemented initiatives in support of the strategic plan,
including the implementation of an integrated marketing software aimed at deepening client relationships, initiation of a
comprehensive review of our banking office network, continued expansion into new markets, and in 2020 and 2021 continued our
efforts to diversify our revenues by expanding our residential mortgage banking and wealth businesses (discussed further below -
Recent Acquisition/Expansion Activity).
Markets. We maintain a blend of large and small markets in Florida and Georgia, all in close proximity to major interstate
thoroughfares such as Interstates 10 and 75. Our larger markets include Tallahassee (Leon County, Florida), Gainesville
(Alachua County, Florida), Macon (Bibb County, Georgia), and Suncoast (Hernando/Pasco/Citrus Counties, Florida). The larger
employers in these markets are state and local governments, healthcare providers, educational institutions, and small businesses,
providing stability and good growth dynamics that have historically grown in excess of the national average. We serve an
additional fifteen smaller, less competitive, rural markets located on the outskirts of, and centered between, our larger markets
where we are positioned as a market leader. In 12 of 18 markets in Florida and two of four Georgia markets, we frequently rank
within the top four banks in terms of deposit market share. Furthermore, in the counties in which we operate, we maintain an
8.4% deposit market share in the Florida counties and 5.4% in the Georgia counties (excluding Northern Arc markets entered in
2022). Our markets provide for a strong core deposit funding base, a key differentiator and driver of our profitability and
franchise value.
Recent Acquisition/Expansion Activity. We have continued our expansion into the Northern Arc of Atlanta, Georgia by opening
full-service offices in Marietta (Cobb County) in the fourth quarter of 2022 and Duluth (Gwinnett County) in the first quarter of
2023. Additionally, we expanded our presence in the Florida Panhandle by opening a full-service office in Watersound, Florida
in the fourth quarter of 2022. To expand our presence and commitment to our Gainesville market, we plan to open a third full-
service banking office in the area in early 2023. During 2022, we hired leadership and banking teams in the Northern Arc and
Walton County office markets, including commercial bankers, retail delivery support, private banking, wealth advisors, and
treasury professionals. Further, CCHL loan originators will reside in the Northern Arc and Walton County offices.
On April 30, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of CCBG, Capital City Strategic Wealth, LLC (“CCSW”) acquired substantially all
of the assets of Strategic Wealth Group, LLC and certain related businesses (“SWG”) – Refer to Note 1 – Significant Accounting
Policies/Business Combination for additional information on this transaction.
On March 1, 2020, CCB completed its acquisition of a 51% membership interest in Brand Mortgage Group, LLC (“Brand”)
which is now operated as CCHL – Refer to Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies/Business Combination for additional
information on this transaction.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
For 2022, net income attributable to common shareowners totaled $40.1 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, compared to net
income of $33.4 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, for 2021 and $31.6 million, or $1.88 per diluted share, for 2020.
The increase in net income attributable to common shareowners for 202 2 was attributable to higher net interest income of $21.6
million and lower noninterest expense of $0.7 million, partially offset by an $8.7 million increase in the provision for credit losses,
lower noninterest income of $12.9 million, and higher income taxes of $0.3 million. Net income attributable to common
shareowners included a $6.4 million decrease in the deduction to record the 49% non-controlling interest in the earnings of CCHL.
The increase in net income attributable to common shareowners for 2021 was attributable to a decrease in the provision for credit
losses of $11.2 million, higher net interest income of $1.5 million and lower income taxes of $0.4 million, partially offset by
higher noninterest expense of $12.5 million and lower noninterest income of $3.6 million. Net income attributable to common
shareowners included a $4.9 million decrease in the deduction to record the 49% non-controlling interest in the earnings of CCHL.
Below areSummary Highlights of our 2022 financial performance:
● Strong growth in net interest income of 21% reflected improved earning asset mix and strength of deposit franchise
● Loan growth of $594 million, or 30.7% (end of period) and $189 million, or 9.4% (year-to-date average)
● Average Deposits grew $356 million, or 10.5%
● CCHL contribution decreased $0.24 per share due to slower secondary market loan sales, but was more than offset by
strong adjustable rate production for our loan portfolio, and higher wealth and deposit fees
● Noninterest expense included pension settlement charges totaling $2.3 million or $0.11 per share
● Tangible book value per share increased $0.54, or 3.2%, primarily due to strong earnings and a favorable re-
measurement adjustment for pension plan, partially offset by higher unrealized investment security losses

Net Interest Income and Margin
Net interest income represents our single largest source of earnings and is equal to interest income and fees generated by earning
assets, less interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. We provide an analysis of our net interest income, including
average yields and rates in Tables 2 and 3 below. We provide this information on a “taxable equivalent” basis to reflect the tax-
exempt status of income earned on certain loans and investments.
For 2022, our taxable equivalent net interest income increased $21.6 million, or 20.9%. This follows an increase of $1.5 million,
or 1.4% in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to strong loan growth, higher interest rates, and growth in the
investment portfolio. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher small business (“SBA PPP”) loan income combined with
lower interest expense, partially offset by lower investment portfolio income due to lower reinvestment rates.
For 2022, taxable equivalent interest income increased $25.0 million, or 23.4%, over 2021. For 2021, taxable equivalent interest
income increased $0.1 million, or 0.1%, over 2020. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to an overall improved earning asset
mix and higher interest rates on earning assets. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to income on SBA PPP loans, partially
offset by lower rates on earning assets.
For 2022, interest expense increased $3.4 million, or 97.4%, over 2021. For 2021, interest expense decreased $1.4 million, or
28.4%, from 2020. The variances for both 2022 and 2021 were related to our negotiated rate deposits, primarily NOW accounts
which were tied to an adjustable rate index until mid-2022. Our cost of interest bearing deposits was 17 basis points in 2022, 4
basis points in 2021, and 10 basis points in 2020. Our total cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing accounts ) was 9 basis
points in 2022, 2 basis points in 2021, and 5 basis points in 2020. To a lesser extent, higher interest expense for our variable rate
short-term borrowings (warehouse line of credit for mortgage banking) and subordinated notes contributed to the increase in
2022. Our total cost of funds (interest expense/average earning assets) was 17 basis points in 2022, 10 basis points in 2021, and
16 basis points in 2020.
38
Our interest rate spread (defined as the taxable-equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest
bearing liabilities) increased 23 basis points in 2022 and decreased 43 basis points in 2021. Our net interest margin (defined as
taxable-equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets) of 3.13% in 2022 reflected a 30 basis
point increase over 2021. The net interest margin of 2.83% in 2021 reflected a 47 basis point decrease from 2020. The increase
in the interest rate spread and net interest margin in 2022 reflected an improved earning asset mix, higher yields across a majority
of our earning assets due to the rapid increase in interest rates, and good control of our deposit cost. The decline in the interest
rate spread and net interest margin in 2021 reflected lower earning asset yields due to lower rates, in addition to a higher level of
lower yielding overnight funds driven by strong deposit growth.
During 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) raised interest rates 425 basis points, putting the federal funds
target rate at a range of 4.25%-4.50%, compared to a range of 0.00%-0.25% at the end of 2021. Our asset sensitive position, with
strong core deposit funding and ample liquidity provide benefits in the higher rate environment.

Provision for Credit Losses
For 2022, we recorded a provision for credit loss expense of $7.2 million ($7.1 million expense for loans HFI and $0.1 million
expense for unfunded loan commitments) compared to a provision benefit of $1.6 million for 2021 ($2.8 million benefit for loans
HFI and $1.2 million expense for unfunded loan commitments), and provision expense of $9.6 million for 2020 ($9.0 million
expense for loans HFI and $0.6 million expense for unfunded loan commitments ). The higher level of provision in 2022 was
primarily attributable to strong loan growth and weaker projected economic conditions, primarily a higher rate of unemployment.
The credit loss provision in 2021 was favorably impacted by strong loan recoveries. We discuss the various factors that have
impacted our provision expense in more detail under the heading Allowance for Credit Losses.
Noninterest Income
For 2022, noninterest income totaled $94.6 million, a $12.9 million decrease from 2021 due to lower mortgage banking revenues
of $21.8 million, partially offset by higher wealth management fees of $4.4 million, deposit fees of $3.2 million, other income of
$1.2 million, and bank card fees of $0.1 million. Lower mortgage banking revenues at CCHL, for 2022 generally reflected a
reduction in refinancing activity and, to a lesser degree, lower purchase mortgage originations primarily driven by higher interest
rates. In addition, gain on sale margins were pressured due to a lower level of governmental loan originations and mandatory
delivery loan sales (both of which provide a higher gain on sale percentage). Strong best efforts adjustable rate production by
CCHL during 2022 contributed to the Bank’s loan growth and earnings.
40
For 2021, noninterest income totaled $107.5 million, a $3.6 million decrease from 2020 primarily attributable to lower mortgage
banking revenues of $10.9 million, partially offset by strong gains in wealth management fees of $2.7 million, bank card fees of
$2.2 million, and deposit fees of $1.1 million. The decline in mortgage banking revenues was driven generally by lower
refinancing activity, a shift in production mix (lower government versus conventional product), and lower market driven gain on
sale margins.
Noninterest income as a percent of total operating revenues (net interest income plus noninterest income) was 43.19% in 2022,
51.11% in 2021, and 52.32% in 2020. In 2022 and 2021, lower mortgage banking revenues drove the decrease in the percentage.
The table below reflects the major components of noninterest income.

Total Noninterest Income $ 94,627 $ $ 107,545 $ 111,165
Significant components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below.
Deposit Fees. For 2022, deposit fees (service charge fees, insufficient fund/overdraft fees, and business account analysis fees)
totaled $22.1 million compared to $18.9 million in 2021 and $17.8 million in 2020. The $3.2 million, or 17.2%, increase in 2022
reflected higher monthly service charge fees and overdraft fees. The conversion, in the third quarter of 2021, of our remaining
free checking accounts to a monthly maintenance fee account type drove the increase in service charge fees. The increase in
overdraft fees was driven by higher utilization of our overdraft service which is closely correlated (inversely) with the consumer
savings rate which has declined noticeably since it substantially increased during 2020 and 2021 due to the high level of
governmental stimulus related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The $1.1 million, or 6.1%, increase in 2021 reflected the
aforementioned conversion of the remaining free checking accounts to a monthly maintenance fee account type.
Bank Card Fees. Bank card fees totaled $15.4 million in 2022 compared to $15.3 million in 2021 and $13.0 million in 2020. The
slight increase in 2022 reflected incremental revenues from growth in new checking accounts that was partially offset by
transaction volume which reflected a slowdown in consumer spending. The favorable variance in 2021 generally reflected an
increase in card-not-present debit card transactions and increased on-line spending by our clients in part due to the pandemic and
significant government stimulus in 2020 and 2021.
Wealth Management Fees. Wealth management fees including both trust fees (i.e., managed accounts and trusts/estates) and
retail brokerage fees (i.e., investment, insurance products, and retirement accounts) totaled $18.1 million in 2022 compared to
$13.7 million in 2021 and $11.0 million in 2020. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to higher insurance revenues of $3.7
million and retail brokerage fees of $0.6 million. The higher level of insurance revenues reflected the acquisition of CCSW in
2021. The increase in fees for 2021 reflected higher retail brokerage fees of $1.8 million and trust fees of $0.8 million. Higher
retail brokerage transaction volume and advisory accounts added from the acquisition of CCSW drove the increase in retail
brokerage fees. The increase in trust fees was primarily attributable to an increase in assets under management. At December 31,
2022, total assets under management (“AUM”) were approximately $2.273 billion compared to $2.324 billion at December 31,
2021 and $1.979 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease in AUM in 2022 generally reflected lower account values/returns
reflective of volatile market conditions during the year partially offset by new account growth.
41
Mortgage Banking Revenues. Mortgage banking revenues totaled $30.6 million in 2022 compared to $52.4 million in 2021 and
$63.3 million in 2020. Lower mortgage banking revenues at CCHL for 2022 reflected a reduction in refinancing activity and, to a
lesser degree, lower purchase mortgage originations primarily driven by higher interest rates. In addition, gain on sale margins
were pressured due to a lower level of governmental loan originations and mandatory delivery loan sales (both of which provide a
higher gain on sale percentage). Throughout 2022, strong best efforts origination volume allowed us to book a steady flow of
adjustable rate residential loans in our portfolio which contributed to loan growth and earnings. In addition, continued stability in
our construction/permanent loan program partially offset the slowdown in secondary market originations. The decrease in 2021
was driven generally by lower refinancing volume, a shift in production mix (lower government versus conventional product),
and lower market driven gain on sale margins. We provide a detailed overview of our mortgage banking operation, including a
detailed break-down of mortgage banking revenues, mortgage servicing activity, and warehouse funding within Note 4 -
Mortgage Banking Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Production volume totaled $1.02 billion in 2022,
$1.52 billion in 2021, and $1.56 billion in 2020. Refinancing activity represented 13% of loan production in 2022, 30% in 2021,
and 40% in 2020. For 2022, CCHL realized a $0.2 million net loss ($0.01 per diluted share) versus $3.9 million net income
($0.23 per diluted share) in 2021, and $8.7 million net income ($0.52 per diluted share) in 2020.
Other. Other noninterest income totaled $8.4 million in 2022 compared to $7.3 million in 2021 and $5.9 million in 2020. The
$1.1 million increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher loan servicing fees at CCHL of $0.5 and a $0.4 million increase
in miscellaneous income, primarily from a $0.2 million gain on the termination of a lease. The $1.4 million increase in 2021 was
primarily attributable to higher loan servicing fees of $1.0 million at CCHL. The higher level of loan servicing fees at CCHL for
both 2021 and 2022 reflected a higher volume of servicing retained loan sales.
Noninterest Expense
For 2022, noninterest expense totaled $161.8 million, a $0.7 million decrease from 2021 due to a decrease in compensation
expense of $0.9 million and other expense of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense of $0.6 million.
The reduction in compensation expense was primarily due to a decrease in salary expense of $1.6 million that was partially offset
by an increase in associate benefit expense of $0.7 million. The variance in salary expense reflected lower variable/performance-
based compensation of $7.7 million and base salaries of $1.3 million at CCHL, partially offset by an increase in salary expense at
the Bank, including variable/performance-based compensation totaling $2.5 million, base salaries (merit and new market staffing
additions) of $3.1 million, and lower realized loan cost of $1.4 million (credit offset to salary expense). The increase in associate
benefit expense was due to an increase in insurance expense (utilized self-insurance reserves in 2021) of $0.6 million and stock
compensation expense of $0.7 million at the Bank. The net decrease in other expense was primarily due to lower pension plan
related costs, including a decrease of $4.9 million for the non-service cost component of our pension plan (reflected in pension –
other) attributable to the utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities and a decrease of $0.8 million for pension plan
settlement expense. These favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in the expense for other real estate expense of
$1.2 million, travel/entertainment and advertising costs of $1.3 million (return to pre-pandemic levels and market expansion),
other losses of $0.9 million (primarily debit card and check fraud), mortgage servicing right amortization of $0.6 million, VISA
share swap conversion ratio payments of $0.4 million, FDIC insurance fees of $0.3 million, and other miscellaneous costs related
to training, hiring, and variable costs related to loan production. Gains from the sale of two banking offices in 2021 drove the
increase in other real estate expense. The increase in occupancy expense is related to lease expense for four new banking offices
added in 2022 and various software purchases, including network security and end of life upgrades.
For 2021, noninterest expense totaled $162.5 million, a $12.5 million increase over 2020 attributable to the addition of expenses
at CCHL (March 1, 2020 acquisition) of $2.3 million and higher expenses at the Bank totaling $10.2 million. The increase in
expenses at the Bank were primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of $3.7 million, including an increase in salary
expense of $3.1 million (merit raises and realized loan cost) and associate benefit expense of $0.6 million (primarily
pension/service cost), occupancy expense of $0.5 million, and other expense of $5.9 million. The increase in occupancy reflected
higher lease expense for two new loan production offices added in 2021 and higher depreciation expense related to technology
investments. The increase in other expense was primarily due to pension plan settlement expense of $3.1 million and higher
expense of $2.1 million for the non-service cost component of our pension plan (reflected in pension – other) attributable to the
utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities. Increases in processing fees of $0.7 million (debit card volume),
professional fees of $0.6 million, and FDIC insurance fees of $0.5 million (higher asset size) that were partially offset by a
decrease in other real estate expense of $1.6 million (gains from the sale of two banking offices in 2021), also contributed to the
increase in other expense.
Our operating efficiency ratio (expressed as noninterest expense as a percent of taxable equivalent net interest income plus
noninterest income) was 71.47%, 77.11% and 70.43% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in this metric for 2022
was primarily driven by higher taxable equivalent net interest income (refer to caption headed Net Interest Income and Margin)
and slightly lower noninterest expense. The increase in this metric for 2021 reflected higher noninterest expense, largely the
aforementioned higher level of pension plan expenses.
42
Expense management is an important part of our culture and strategic focus. We will continue to review and evaluate
opportunities to optimize our delivery operations and invest in technology that provides favorable returns/scale and/or mitigates
risk. The table below reflects the major components of noninterest expense.

Significant components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail below.
Compensation. Compensation expense totaled $100.5 million in 2022 compared to $101.5 million in 2021, and $96.3 million in
2020. For 2022, the $0.9 million, or 0.9%, net decrease reflected a decrease in salary expense of $1.6 million that was partially
offset by an increase in associate benefit expense of $0.7 million. The decrease in salary expense was primarily due to lower
variable/performance-based compensation of $7.7 million and base salaries of $1.3 million at CCHL, partially offset by an
increase in salary expense at the Bank, primarily variable/performance -based compensation totaling $2.5 million, base salaries
(merit and new market staffing additions) of $3.1 million, and a decrease in realized loan cost of $1.4 million (credit offset to
salary expense). Further, the increase in associate benefit expense was primarily due to an increases in expenses at the Bank,
including associate insurance expense (utilized self-insurance reserves in 2021) of $0.6 million and stock compensation expense
of $0.7 million that was partially offset by a decrease in pension plan service cost of $0.5 million.
For 2021, the $5.2 million, or 5.4%, net increase was attributable to increases in salary expense of $4.4 million and associate
benefit expense of $0.8 million. Increases in salary expense of $3.1 million and associate benefit expense of $0.6 million at the
Bank drove a majority of the increase with the addition of CCHL compensation expense for a full 12-month period in 2021 versus
a ten month period in 2020 driving the remaining portion of the variance. The higher level of salary expense at the Bank reflected
an increase in base salaries of $1.8 million, primarily merit raises, and a decrease in realized loan cost of $0.8 million (credit
offset to salary expense). The increase in associate benefit expense at the Bank was attributable to an increase in pension plan
service cost of $1.1 million partially offset by a decrease in associate insurance expense of $0.4 million.
Occupancy. Occupancy expense (including premises and equipment) totaled $24.5 million for 2022 compared to $23.9 million
for 2021, and $22.7 million for 2020. For 2022, the $0.6 million, or 2.7%, increase was attributable to increases in software
license expense of $0.5 million and banking office lease expense of $0.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and
repairs expense of $0.1 million. The increase in software license expense reflected software upgrades for personal computers and
network servers, and additional investment in network security monitoring software.
43
For 2021, the $1.2 million, or 5.3%, increase was attributable to an increase in occupancy expense of $0.5 million at the Bank
primarily related to depreciation and software license expense for additional ATM/ITM investments and other infrastructure
investments for business line support and risk management. The remainder of the variance reflected CCHL occupancy expense
for a full 12-month period versus a ten month period in 2020.
Other. Other noninterest expense totaled $36.7 million in 2022 compared to $37.1 million in 2021 and $31.0 million in 2020.
For 2022, the $0.4 million, or 1.1%, decrease was due to lower expenses at the Bank, primarily a decrease in pension related
costs, including a decrease of $4.9 million for the non-service cost component of our pension plan (reflected in pension – other)
attributable to the utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities and a decrease of $0.8 million for pension plan settlement
expense. These favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in expenses for other real estate of $1.2 million (lower
gains from the sale of banking offices), travel/entertainment and advertising costs totaling $1.3 million (return to pre -pandemic
levels and market expansion), and insurance – other (FDIC insurance premiums) of $0.3 million. Additional increases were
realized in the following expenses that are reflected in the miscellaneous expense category: other losses of $0.9 million (primarily
debit card and check fraud), mortgage servicing right amortization of $0.6 million (higher level of servicing retained loan sales),
VISA Class B share swap conversion ratio payments of $0.4 million, and other miscellaneous costs for training, hiring, and
variable expenses related to loan production.
For 2021, the $6.1 million, or 19.7%, increase was driven by an increase in other expenses at the Bank of $5.9 million, primarily
an increase in pension related expenses, including higher expense of $2.1 million for the non-service cost component of our
pension plan attributable to the utilization of a lower discount rate for plan liabilities. Additionally, we incurred $3.1 million in
pension settlement charges in 2021 related to a high level of lump sum payments to retirees. Lastly, we realized an increase in
expense for processing fees of $0.7 million (debit card volume), professional fees of $0.6 million (temporary staffing support),
and insurance – other (FDIC insurance premiums) of $0.5 million (larger asset size), that were partially offset by a decrease in
other real estate expense of $1.6 million (higher gains from the sale of banking offices) contributed to the increase.
Income Taxes
For 2022, we realized income tax expense of $10.1 million (effective rate of 20%) compared to $9.8 million (effective rate of
20%) for 2021 and $10.2 million (effective rate of 19%) for 2020. Income tax expense for 2022 and 2021 was unfavorably
impacted due to lower CCHL income. For 2022, income tax expense was favorably impacted by $0.4 million related to tax
benefits accrued via a 2022 investment in a solar tax credit equity fund. Further, 2022 income tax expense was favorably
impacted by discrete tax items totaling $0.7 million related to a favorable deferred tax adjustment for our Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan and a State of Florida corporate tax refund. Income tax expense for 2021 was unfavorably impacted by net
discrete tax items totaling $0.3 million.
In September 2021, Florida enacted a corporate tax rate reduction from 4.5% to 3.535% retroactive to January 1, 2021, with an
expiration date of December 31, 2021, therefore, there was no material impact to our deferred tax accounts. Our 2021 and 2020
state tax rates were adjusted to reflect the one percentage point (2020) and two percentage point (2021) reductions each year. The
Florida tax rate reverted to 5.5% effective January 1, 2022.
Absent discrete items, we expect our annual effective tax rate to approximate 21%-22% in 2023.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Average assets totaled approximately $4.332 billion for 2022, an increase of $348.2 million, or 8.7%, over 2021. Average
earning assets were approximately $3.989 billion for 2022, an increase of $336.8 million, or 9.2%, over 2021. Compared to 2021,
average overnight funds decreased $141.1 million, while investment securities increased $318.8 million and average loans held
for investment were higher by $188.9 million. We discuss these variances in more detail below.
Table 2 provides information on average balances and rates, Table 3 provides an analysis of rate and volume variances and Table
6 highlights the changing mix of our interest earning assets over the last three fiscal years.
44
Loans
In 2022, average loans HFI increased $188.9 million, or 9.4%, compared to an increase of $43.0 million, or 2.2%, in 2021.
Compared to 2021, the growth in average loans was broad based with increases realized in most loan categories, more
significantly so in the residential real estate, construction, and consumer (indirect auto) segments. Total loans HFI at December
31, 2022 totaled $2.525 billion, a $594 million increase over December 31, 2021 and primarily reflected higher balances in the
following categories: residential real estate of $375 million, commercial real estate of $119 million, and construction of $60
million. At December 31, 2022, our consumer loans balances reflected direct loans of $22 million and indirect auto loans of $303
million. During 2022, indirect auto balances peaked at $338 million in May, but declined gradually for the remainder of the year
as we focused on reducing exposure to this loan segment which totaled $303 million at December 31, 2022.
As part of our overall strategy, we will purchase newly originated 1-4 family real estate secured adjustable rate loans from CCHL.
The strategic alliance with CCHL provides us a larger pool of loan purchase opportunities, including participation loans for
construction/perm product, which in large part drove the aforementioned increases in residential real estate and construction
loans.
Expansion into new markets in the Northern Arc of Atlanta, Georgia (Cobb and Gwinnett Counties) and Walton County, Florida
drove incremental loan growth of approximately $65 million in 2022 as we added to those banking teams throughout 2022.
In 2022, average loans held for sale (“HFS”) decreased $29.8 million, or 38.1%, from 2021 due to lower loan volume at CCHL.
Loans HFI and HFS as a percentage of average earning assets decreased slightly to 56.1% in 2022 compared to 56.9% in 2021,
primarily attributable to an increase in our investment portfolio.

The composition of our HFI loan portfolio at December 31 for each of the past three years is shown in Table 7. Table 8 arrays
our HFI loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, by maturity period. As a percentage of the HFI loan portfolio, loans with fixed
interest rates represented 33.3% at December 31, 2022 compared to 39.3% at December 31, 2021. A higher level of 1-4 family
real estate secured adjustable rate loan production in 2022 drove the decrease in the percentage.

Credit Quality
Table 9 provides the components of nonperforming assets and various other credit quality and risk metrics at December 31st for
the last three fiscal years. Information regarding our accounting policies related to nonaccruals, past due loans, and troubled debt
restructurings is provided in Note 3 – Loans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses.
Overall credit quality continues to remain strong. Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and other real estate) totaled $2.7
million at December 31, 2022 compared to $4.3 million at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, nonperforming assets as a
percent of total assets was 0.06%, a decrease of four basis points from December 31, 2021.

Nonaccrual Loans. Nonaccrual loans totaled $2.3 million at December 31, 2022, a $2.0 million decrease from December 31,
2021. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or management
deems the collectability of the principal and interest to be doubtful. Once a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, all previously
accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized when the
ultimate collectability is no longer considered doubtful. Loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest
amounts contractually due are brought current or when future payments are reasonably assured. If interest on our loans classified
as nonaccrual during 2022 had been recognized on a fully accruing basis, we would have recorded an additional $0.2 million of
interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Other Real Estate Owned. OREO represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans or by receiving a deed
in lieu of foreclosure. OREO is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of
foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses. On an ongoing basis,
properties are either revalued internally or by a third-party appraiser as required by applicable regulations. Subsequent declines in
value are reflected as other noninterest expense. Carrying costs related to maintaining the OREO properties are expensed as
incurred and are also reflected as other noninterest expense.
OREO totaled $0.4 million at December 31, 2022 versus $0.02 million at December 31, 2021. During 2022, we added properties
totaling $2.4 million and sold properties totaling $2.0 million. For 2021, we added properties totaling $1.7 million, sold
properties totaling $2.8 million, and recorded net favorable valuation adjustments totaling $0.3 million.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”). TDRs are loans on which, due to the deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition,
the original terms have been modified and deemed a concession to the borrower. From time to time we will modify a loan as a
workout alternative. Most of these instances involve an extension of the loan term, an interest rate reduction, or a principal
moratorium. A TDR classification can be removed if the borrower’s financial condition improves such that the borrower is no
longer in financial difficulty, the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest, and the loan is subsequently refinanced
or restructured at market terms and qualifies as a new loan in calendar years after the year in which the restructuring took place.
Loans classified as TDRs at December 31, 2022 totaled $6.1 million compared to $8.0 million at December 31, 2021. Accruing
TDRs made up approximately $5.9 million of our TDR portfolio at December 31, 2022, of which $0.3 million was over 30 days
past due. The weighted average rate for the loans within the accruing TDR portfolio was 5.96%. During 2022, we modified two
loan contracts totaling approximately $0.1 million compared to three loan contracts totaling approximately $0.6 million during
2021. Our TDR default rate (default balance as a percentage of average TDRs) in 2022 and 2021 was 0.0% and 4.1%,
respectively.
47
Past Due Loans. A loan is defined as a past due loan when one full payment is past due or a contractual maturity is over 30 days
past due. Past due loans at December 31, 2022 totaled $7.8 million compared to $3.6 million at December 31, 2021. Indirect
auto loans represented a large portion of the increase and at December 31, 2022 reflected 73% of total dollars past due and 72%
of total dollars past due at December 31, 2021.
Potential Problem Loans. Potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has
doubt as to the borrower’s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms. At December 31, 2022, we had $2.8 million in
loans of this type which were not included in either of the nonaccrual, TDR or 90 day past due loan categories compared to $1.5
million at December 31, 2021. Management monitors these loans closely and reviews their performance on a regular basis.
Loan Concentrations. Loan concentrations exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar
activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amount exceeds 10% of total
loans. Due to the lack of diversified industry within our markets and the relatively close proximity of the markets, we have both
geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded. Specifically, due to the nature of our markets, a
significant portion of our HFI loan portfolio has historically been secured with real estate, approximately 77% at December 31,
2022 and 72% at December 31, 2021 with the increase driven by a higher volume of 1-4 family residential real estate loans
originated in 2022. The primary types of real estate collateral are commercial properties and 1-4 family residential properties.
We review our loan portfolio segments and concentration limits on an ongoing basis and will make adjustments as needed to
mitigate/reduce risk to segments that reflect decline or stress.
We have established an internal lending limit of $10 million for the total aggregate amount of credit that will be extended to a
client and any related entities within our Board approved policies. This compares to our legal lending limit of approximately $91
million.
The following table summarizes our real estate loan category as segregated by the type of property. Property type concentrations

A major portion of our real estate loan category is centered in the owner occupied category which carries a lower risk of non-
collection than certain segments of the investor category. Approximately 42% of the investor real estate category was secured by
residential real estate at December 31, 2022.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net
amount expected to be collected on the loans. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted by a credit loss provision which is
reported in earnings and reduced by the charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. Loans are charged off against the
allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the
aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Expected credit loss inherent in non-cancellable
off-balance sheet credit exposures is provided through the credit loss provision, but recorded separately in other liabilities.
Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to
past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loan default and loss experience provides the
basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information incorporate management’s view of
current conditions and forecasts.
Detailed information regarding the methodology for estimating the amount reported in the allowance for credit losses is provided
in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies/Allowance for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
48
Note 3 – Loans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses in the Consolidated Financial Statements provides the
activity in the allowance and the allocation by loan type for each of the past three fiscal years.
For 2022, we realized net loan charge-offs of $3.9 million, or 0.18%, of average HFI loans, compared to net loan recoveries of
$0.6 million, or 0.03%, for 2021, and net loan charge-offs of $2.4 million, or 0.12%, for 2020. A majority of the increase in 2022
reflected higher commercial loan charge-offs and consumer loan (indirect auto) charge-offs, as well as a significant reduction in
loan recoveries. The increase in commercial loan charge-offs was primarily attributable to one problem loan relationship that was
resolved in the second quarter of 2022.
At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses represented 0.98% of HFI loans and provided coverage of 1,077% of
nonperforming loans compared to 1.12% and 500%, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 1.19% and 406%, respectively, at
December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses for HFI loans totaled $24.7 million compared to $21.6 million at December
31, 2021 and $23.8 million at December 31, 2020. Incremental allowance related to loan growth, a higher projected rate of
unemployment and its effect on rates of default, and slower prepayment speeds (due to higher interest rates) were all contributing
factors driving the $3.1 million increase in the allowance during 2022. The $2.2 million decrease in the allowance for credit
losses in 2021 reflected improvements in forecasted economic conditions, favorable loan migration and net loan recoveries
totaling $0.6 million, partially offset by incremental reserves needed for loan growth (excluding SBA PPP).

Investment Securities
Our average investment portfolio balance increased $318.8 million, or 40.7%, in 2022 and increased $203.4 million, or 35.1%, in
2021. As a percentage of average earning assets, our investment portfolio represented 27.6% in 2022, compared to 21.4% in
2021. In 2022, the growth in the investment portfolio was attributable to an investment purchase program implemented to take
advantage of higher rates and deploy a portion of our excess liquidity , in addition to reinvesting a portion of the portfolio cash
flow during the year. As we continue to monitor our overall liquidity levels throughout 2023, we will allow cash flow from the
investment portfolio to run-off and we will review various investment strategies as appropriate.
In 2022, average taxable investments increased $319.9 million, or 41.1%, while tax-exempt investments decreased $1.1 million,
or 29.3%. Taxable bonds increased as part of our overall investment strategy, and non-taxable investments decreased as the tax-
equivalent yield was generally unattractive throughout 2022 compared to taxable investments. At December 31, 2022, municipal
securities (taxable and non-taxable) comprised 3.8% of the portfolio.
Our investment portfolio is a significant component of our operations and, as such, it functions as a key element of liquidity and
asset/liability management. Two types of classifications are approved for investment securities which are Available -for-Sale
(“AFS”) and Held-for-Maturity (“HTM”). In 2022 and 2021, we purchased securities under both the AFS and HTM designations.
At December 31, 2022, $413.3 million, or 38.5% of our investment portfolio was classified as AFS, with $660.7 million, or
61.5%, classified as HTM. At December 31, 2021, the AFS and HTM portfolio comprised 65.8% and 34.1%, respectively.
During the third quarter of 2022, U.S. Treasury obligations totaling $168.4 million with unrealized losses of $9.4 million were
transferred from AFS to HTM. At December 31, 2022, $7.9 million was remaining in unrealized losses for these securities.

The classification of a security is determined upon acquisition based on how the purchase will affect our asset/liability strategy
and future business plans and opportunities. Classification determinations will also factor in regulatory capital requirements,
volatility in earnings or other comprehensive income, and liquidity needs. Securities in the AFS portfolio are recorded at fair
value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded net of tax, in the accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) component of shareowners’ equity. Securities designated as HTM are those acquired or owned with
the intent of holding them to maturity (final payment date). HTM investments are measured at amortized cost. It is neither
management’s current intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains
and therefore we do not maintain a trading portfolio.
At December 31, 2022, there were 928 positions (combined AFS and HTM) with pre-tax unrealized losses totaling $90.0 million.
The GNMA mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasuries, and SBA securities held carry the full faith and credit guarantee of the
U.S. Government, and are 0% risk-weighted assets. Other mortgage-backed securities held (Federal National Mortgage
Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) are issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities. Direct
obligations of U.S. Government agencies (Federal Farm Credit Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta) are also owned.
We believe the long history of no credit losses on government securities indicates that the expectation of nonpayment of the
amortized cost basis is zero. A large portion of the SBA securities float monthly or quarterly with the prime rate and are
uncapped. The remaining positions owned are municipal and corporate bonds. At December 31, 2022, 26 corporate positions
had a total allowance for credit loss of $28,000 and 21 municipal positions had a total allowance for credit loss of $13,000. All of
these positions maintain an overall rating of at least “A-”, and all are expected to mature at par.
The average maturity of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 3.57 years compared to 3.62 years at December 31,
2021. The average life of our investment portfolio decreased slightly primarily due to the natural aging of the portfolio, partially
offset by a portion of the portfolio being reinvested into short-to-intermediate term securities.
The weighted average taxable equivalent yield of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 was 2.03% versus 1.12% in
2021. This increase in yield reflected higher reinvestment rates during 2022. Our bond portfolio contained no investments in
obligations, other than U.S. Governments, of any state, municipality, political subdivision, or any other issuer that exceeded 10%
of our shareowners’ equity at December 31, 2022.

Deposits and Short-Term Borrowings
Average total deposits for 2022 were $3.763 billion, an increase of $356.5 million, or 10.5%, over 2021. Average deposits
increased $562.5 million, or 19.8%, from 2020 to 2021. Both year-over-year increases occurred in all deposit types except
certificates of deposit, with the largest increases occurring in noninterest bearing, NOW accounts, and savings accounts.
Strong deposit growth occurred during 2022 reflecting additional federal stimulus inflows as well as core deposit growth. In
addition, strong seasonal growth of public funds occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022 which is expected to be drawn down over
the course of 2023.
The FOMC has increased their benchmark interest rate aggressively by 425 basis points during 2022. This resulted in a shift in
deposit mix which we began to see in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily in two large corporate clients totaling approximately
$40 million that migrated from noninterest bearing to interest bearing deposit accounts. Also in the fourth quarter, we began to
realize some run-off of stimulus funds and core deposits from our more rate sensitive clients in favor of higher yielding
investments. We have several strategies in place to protect core deposits and mitigate deposit run-off, and we will continue to
closely monitor several metrics such as the sensitivity of our clients to our deposit rates, our overall liquidity position, and
competitor rates when pricing deposits. This strategy is consistent with previous rate cycles and allows us to manage the mix of
our deposits as well as the overall client relationship rather than competing solely on rate. We believe this enabled us to maintain
a low cost of funds (interest expense/average earning assets) of 17 basis points for 2022 and 10 basis points for 2021.

Table 2 provides an analysis of our average deposits, by category, and average rates paid thereon for each of the last three fiscal
years. Table 14 reflects the shift in our deposit mix over the last year and Table 15 provides a maturity distribution of time
deposits in denominations of $250,000 and over at December 31, 2022. For 2022, noninterest bearing deposits represented 44.9%
of total average deposits. This compares to 44.7% in 2021 and 44.1% in 2020.
Average short -term borrowings decreased $13.0 million in 2022 primarily due to the decline in warehouse line borrowings at
CCHL that are used to support our held for sale loan portfolio. See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on short-term borrowings.
We continue to focus on the value of our deposit franchise, which produces a strong base of core deposits with minimal reliance
on wholesale funding.

Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity
Overview. Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. We have risk
management policies designed to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and we do not participate in activities that give rise to
significant market risk involving exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices. In asset and liability management activities,
our policies are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk Management. Our net income is largely dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to
interest rate risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest-earning
assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, a significant
increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or
reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling market interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest
income. Net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest-earning assets that are funded by interest-
bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds, such as noninterest -bearing deposits and shareowners’ equity.
52
We have established what we believe to be a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy, which is administered by
management’s Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”). The policy establishes limits of risk, which are quantitative
measures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of equity
capital (a measure of economic value of equity (“EVE”) at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for
maturities from one day to 30 years. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our
short-term earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling. The
simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and
loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest
rate modeling methodology used by us. When interest rates change, actual movements in different categories of interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly
from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have
on adjustable-rate loan clients’ ability to service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit
products.
The statement of financial condition is subject to testing for interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate
risk. We prepare a current base case and several alternative interest rate simulations (+/- 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points
(bp)), at least once per quarter, and report the analysis to ALCO, our Market Risk Oversight Committee (“MROC”), our Risk
Oversight Committee (“ROC”) and the Board of Directors. (The -200bp, -300bp, and -400bp rate scenarios were not modeled in
2021 due to the low interest rate environment below 2.00%). We augment our interest rate shock analysis with alternative interest
rate scenarios on a quarterly basis that may include ramps, parallel shifts, and a flattening or steepening of the yield curve (non-
parallel shift). In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other
business conditions so dictate.
Our goal is to structure the statement of financial condition so that net interest earnings at risk over 12-month and 24-month
periods and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels. We
attempt to achieve this goal by balancing, within policy limits, the volume of floating-rate liabilities with a similar volume of
floating-rate assets, by keeping the average maturity of fixed-rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched, by managing
the mix of our core deposits, and by adjusting our rates to market conditions on a continuing basis. At December 31, 2022, the
instantaneous rate shock of -200bp, -300bp and -400bp over 12-months and over 24-months was outside of the desired parameters
due to the limited ability to reprice deposits in these respective shock scenarios.
Analysis. Measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution’s short-term
performance in alternative rate environments. These measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period, and do not
necessarily indicate the long-term prospects or economic value of the institution.

The Net Interest Income at risk position was generally less favorable at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 for
the 12-month and 24-month shocks for rising rate scenarios. Strong loan growth and a reduction in our overnight funds balance
during the year made us less asset sensitive, which is less favorable in rising rate environments, and more favorable in a falling
rate environment.
Net Interest Income at risk is within our prescribed policy limits over both the 12-month and 24-month periods for all rising rate
scenarios, and the down 100 bps rate scenario. The percent change over both a 12-month and 24-month shock are outside of
policy in a rates down 200 bps, down 300 bps, and down 400 bps scenarios due to our limited ability to lower our deposit rates
relative to the decline in market rate. In addition, this analysis incorporates an instantaneous, parallel shock and assumes we
move with market rates and do not lag our deposit rates.
53
The measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value by considering the effects of changes in interest rates
on all of our cash flows by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The difference
between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity, which in theory approximates the fair
value of our net assets.

(1) Down 200, 300 and 400 bp rate scenarios have been added due to the current interest rate environment.
At December 31, 2022, the economic value of equity was favorable in all rising rate environments and was within prescribed
tolerance levels. Factors that can impact EVE values include the absolute level of rates, the overall structure of the balance sheet
(including liquidity levels), pre-payment speeds, loan floors, and the change of model assumptions.
Although the change in EVE exceeds policy guidelines in the down 300 bps and down 400 bps rate scenarios, the EVE Ratios
(EVE/EVA) were 12.0% and 10.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2022 and were therefore within policy guidelines. EVE is out
of compliance only if BOTH the EVE and EVE ratio are outside of policy guidelines. Therefore, EVE is currently in compliance
with policy in all rate scenarios.
As the interest rate environment and the dynamics of the economy continue to change, additional simulations will be analyzed to
address not only the changing rate environment, but also the changing statement of financial condition mix, measured over
multiple years, to help assess the risk to the Company.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet our cash needs. Our objective in managing our liquidity is to
maintain our ability to fund loan commitments, purchase securities, accommodate deposit withdrawals or repay other liabilities in
accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on our current or future earnings. Our liquidity strategy is guided by
policies that are formulated and monitored by our ALCO and senior management, and which take into account the marketability
of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. We regularly evaluate all of our various
funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility, stability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness. For 2022 and 2021, our principal
source of funding was client deposits, supplemented by our short-term and long-term borrowings, primarily from our trust-
preferred securities, securities sold under repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, and FHLB borrowings. We believe
that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our
future operating capital and funding requirements.
At December 31, 2022, we had the ability to generate approximately $1.354 billion in additional liquidity through all of our
available resources beyond our overnight funds sold position. In addition to the primary borrowing outlets mentioned above, we
also have the ability to generate liquidity by borrowing from the Federal Reserve Discount Window and through brokered
deposits. We recognize the importance of maintaining liquidity and have developed a Contingent Liquidity Plan, which addresses
various liquidity stress levels and our response and action based on the level of severity. We periodically test our credit facilities
for access to the funds, but also understand that as the severity of the liquidity level increases certain credit facilities may no
longer be available. We conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests and the results are reported to ALCO, MROC, ROC and the Board
of Directors. We believe the liquidity available to us is sufficient to meet our ongoing needs.
We also view our investment portfolio as a liquidity source and have the option to pledge securities in our portfolio as collateral
for borrowings or deposits, and/or to sell selected securities. Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S.
governmental agencies, municipal governments, and corporate entities. The weighted-average maturity of our portfolio was 3.57
years at December 31, 2022 and the available-for-sale portfolio had a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $41.9 million.

Our average net overnight funds sold position (defined as funds sold plus interest-bearing deposits with other banks less funds
purchased) was $649.8 million in 2022 compared to an average net overnight funds sold position of $790.9 million in 2021. The
declining overnight funds position in 2022 reflected strong growth in average loans.
We expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to be approximately $8.0 million, which will consist primarily of
technology purchases for banking offices, office leasehold improvements, business applications, and information technology
security needs as well as furniture and fixtures and banking office remodels. We expect that these capital expenditures will be
funded with existing resources without impairing our ability to meet our ongoing obligations.
Borrowings
At December 31, 2022, total advances from the FHLB consisted of $0.6 million in outstanding debt comprised of three notes. In
2022, the Bank made FHLB advance payments totaling $0.9 million. Two advances matured, none were paid off, and no new
fixed rate advances were obtained in 2022. The FHLB notes are collateralized by a floating lien on certain 1-4 family residential
mortgage loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, and home equity mortgage loans.
We have issued two junior subordinated deferrable interest notes to wholly owned Delaware statutory trusts. The first note for
$30.9 million was issued to CCBG Capital Trust I in November 2004. The second note for $32.0 million was issued to CCBG
Capital Trust II in May 2005.
In the second quarter of 2020, we entered into a derivative cash flow hedge of our interest rate risk related to our subordinated
debt. The notional amount of the derivative is $30 million ($10 million of the CCBG Capital Trust I borrowing and $20 million
of the CCBG Capital Trust II borrowing). The interest rate swap agreement requires CCBG to pay fixed and receive variable
(Libor plus spread) and has an average all-in fixed rate of 2.50% for 10 years. Additional detail on the interest rate swap
agreement is provided in Note 5 – Derivatives in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
For 2022, average short-term borrowings, consisting primarily of CCHL warehouse line balances, declined $13.0 million
compared to 2021 due to lower residential loan production volume which reduced short-term borrowing needs.
See Note 11 – Short Term Borrowings and Note 12 – Long Term Borrowings in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on borrowings.
In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future
payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for the expected timing
of such payments as of December 31, 2022. These include payments related to (i) long-term borrowings (Note 12 – Long-Term
Borrowings), (ii) short-term borrowings (Note 11 – Short-Term Borrowings), (iii) operating leases (Note 7 – Leases), (iv) time
deposits with stated maturities (Note 10 – Deposits), and (v) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 21 –
Commitments and Contingencies).
Capital Resources
Shareowners’ equity was $394.0 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $383.2 million at December 31, 2021. For 2022,
shareowners’ equity was positively impacted by net income attributable to common shareowners of $40.1 million, a $3.1 million
increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap related to subordinated debt, stock compensation accretion of $1.3 million, net
adjustments totaling $1.6 million related to transactions under our stock compensation plans, and an $8.7 million decrease in the
accumulated other comprehensive loss for our pension plan. Shareowners’ equity was reduced by common stock dividends of
$11.2 million ($0.66 per share) and a $32.8 million increase in the unrealized loss on investment securities. Additional historical
information on capital changes is provided in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareowners’ Equity in the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We continue to maintain a strong capital position. The ratio of shareowners' equity to total assets at December 31, 2022 was
8.71% compared to 8.99% at December 31, 2021. Further, our tangible common equity ratio was 6.79 % (non-GAAP financial
measure) at December 31, 2022 compared to 6.95% at December 31, 2021. The decline in the ratios in 2022 was substantially
due to an increase in the unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities.
We are subject to regulatory risk-based capital requirements that measure capital relative to risk-weighted assets and off-balance
sheet financial instruments. At December 31, 2022, our total risk-based capital ratio was 15.52% compared to 17.15% at
December 31, 2021. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 12.64% and 13.86%, respectively, on these dates. Our leverage
ratio was 9.06% and 8.95%, respectively, on these dates. With the exception of the leverage ratio, the decline in our regulatory
capital ratios compared to 2021 was attributable to strong loan growth during 2022. For a detailed discussion of our regulatory
capital requirements, refer to the “Regulatory Considerations – Capital Regulations” section on page 15. See Note 17 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information as to our capital adequacy.
55
At December 31, 2022, our common stock had a book value of $23.12 per diluted share compared to $22.63 at December 31,
2021. Book value is impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities. At December 31, 2022, the net
unrealized loss was $37.3 million compared to an unrealized loss of $4.6 million at December 31, 2021. Book value is also
impacted by the recording of our unfunded pension liability through other comprehensive income in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 715. At December 31, 2022, the net pension liability reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
loss was $4.5 million compared to $13.2 million at December 31, 2021. The favorable adjustment to our unfunded pension
liability reflected a higher discount rate used to calculate the present value of the pension obligation that was partially offset by a
lower than estimated return on plan assets. The higher discount rate reflected the increase in long-term interest rates in 2022.
This adjustment also favorably impacted our tangible capital ratio. Further, book value is impacted by the periodic adjustment
made to record temporary equity at redemption value and there were no adjustments made during 2022.
In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1,500,000 shares of our outstanding common stock
over a five-year period. Repurchases under the 2014 plan could be made in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions; however, we were not obligated to repurchase any specified number of shares. In January 2019, the 2014 plan was
terminated and our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan that authorizes the repurchase of up to 750,000
shares of our outstanding common stock over a five-year period. Terms of this plan are substantially similar to the 2014 plan. No
shares were repurchased in 2022 or 2021. 99,952 shares were repurchased in 2020 at an average price of $20.39 and 77,000
shares were repurchased in 2019 at an average price of $23.40. Since 2014, a total of 1,361,682 shares of our outstanding
common stock have been repurchased at an average price of $17. 93 under our stock repurchase plans. In January 2023, we
repurchased 25,000 shares of our common stock at $32.39 per share.
Dividends
Adequate capital and financial strength are paramount to our stability and the stability of CCB. Cash dividends declared and paid
should not place unnecessary strain on our capital levels. When determining the level of dividends, the following factors are
considered:
● Compliance with state and federal laws and regulations;
● Our capital position and our ability to meet our financial obligations;
● Projected earnings and asset levels; and
● The ability of the Bank and us to fund dividends.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs
of our clients. See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
If commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels, management does not
anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on-going obligations. In the event these commitments
require funding in excess of historical levels, management believes current liquidity, investment security maturities, available
advances from the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank, and warehouse lines of credit provide a sufficient source of funds to meet
these commitments.
In conjunction with the sale and securitization of loans held for sale and their related servicing rights, we may be exposed to
liability resulting from recourse, repurchase, and make-whole agreements. If it is determined subsequent to our sale of a loan or
its related servicing rights that a breach of the representations or warranties made in the applicable sale agreement has occurred,
which may include guarantees that prepayments will not occur within a specified and customary time frame, we may have an
obligation to either (a) repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance, accrued interest, and related advances; (b) indemnify
the purchaser against any loss it suffers; or (c) make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of the loan and its related
servicing rights.
Our repurchase, indemnification and make-whole obligations vary based upon the terms of the applicable agreements, the nature
of the asserted breach, and the status of the mortgage loan at the time a claim is made. We establish reserves for estimated losses
of this nature inherent in the origination of mortgage loans by estimating the losses inherent in the population of all loans sold
based on trends in claims and actual loss severities experienced. The reserve will include accruals for probable contingent losses
in addition to those identified in the pipeline of claims received. The estimation process is designed to include amounts based on
actual losses experienced from actual activity.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to make various estimates and
assumptions (see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We believe that, of our significant accounting
policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
Allowance for Credit Losses. The amount of the allowance for credit losses represents management’s best estimate of current
expected credit losses considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to
credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. Relevant available information includes historical credit loss experience,
current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. While historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the
estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may be made for changes in loan risk grades, loss
experience trends, loan prepayment trends, differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions,
future expectations, or other relevant factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the
ultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the
performance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates, and the view of the regulatory authorities toward
classification of assets. Detailed information on the Allowance for Credit Losses valuation, and the assumptions used are provided
in Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of their identifiable net
assets. We perform an impairment review on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations, or other
factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is
less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value.
We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and in 2017 adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying Accounting for Goodwill Impairment which allows for a qualitative assessment
of goodwill impairment indicators. If the assessment indicates that impairment has more than likely occurred, the Company must
compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds
its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual impairment testing. We proceeded with qualitative assessment by
evaluating impairment indicators and concluded there were none that indicated that goodwill impairment had occurred.
Pension Assumptions. We have a defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of substantially all of our associates. Our funding
policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute, at a minimum, amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements
as set by law. Pension expense is determined by an external actuarial valuation based on assumptions that are evaluated annually
as of December 31, the measurement date for the pension obligation. The service cost component of pension expense is reflected
as “Compensation Expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All other components of pension expense are reflected as
“Other Expense”.
The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition reflect an accrued pension benefit cost due to funding levels and
unrecognized actuarial amounts. The most significant assumptions used in calculating the pension obligation are the weighted-
average discount rate used to determine the present value of the pension obligation, the weighted-average expected long-term rate
of return on plan assets, and the assumed rate of annual compensation increases. These assumptions are re-evaluated annually
with the external actuaries, taking into consideration both current market conditions and anticipated long-term market conditions.
The discount rate is determined by matching the anticipated defined pension plan cash flows to the spot rates of a corporate AA-
rated bond index/yield curve and solving for the single equivalent discount rate which would produce the same present value.
This methodology is applied consistently from year to year. The discount rate utilized in 2022 was 3.11%. The estimated impact
to 2022 pension expense of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been an approximate $0.9
million decrease or increase, respectively. We anticipate using a 5.63% discount rate in 2023.
Based on the balances at the December 31, 2022 measurement date, the estimated impact on accumulated other comprehensive
loss of a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have been a decrease or increase of approximately $2.2
million (after-tax). The estimated impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss of a 1% favorable/unfavorable variance in the
actual rate of return on plan assets versus the assumed rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% would have been an approximate
$1.2 million (after-tax) decrease/increase, respectively.
