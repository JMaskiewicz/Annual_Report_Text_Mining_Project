Insurance—Underwriting
Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of
Berkshire’sChairmanandCEO,WarrenE.BuffettandBerkshire’scorporateinvestmentmanagers.Accordingly,weevaluate
performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We
consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider
investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not
meaningfulinunderstandingtheperiodicoperatingresultsofourinsurancebusinesses.

Pre-taxunderwritinglossesbeforeforeigncurrencyexchangeeffectswere$696millionin2022,$526millionin2021
and $550 million in 2020. Pre-tax losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to the termination of a
reinsurance contract, in which the settlement paid exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were
partiallyoffsetbytheeffectsofhighermortalityandbyhigherinterestratesapplicabletosettlementsundercertaincontracts.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected

Retroactivereinsurance
Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the
claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion and deferred charges were $9.9
billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that
maximumremaininggrosslossespayableunderourretroactivepolicieswillnotexceed$52billion.Absentsignificantjudicial
or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that
losseswilldevelopupwardtothemaximumlossespayableordownwardbymorethan15%ofourestimatedgrossliability.
Weestablishliabilityestimatesbyindividualcontract,consideringexposureanddevelopmenttrends.Inestablishingour
liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under
various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We
thenmonitorsubsequentlosspaymentactivityandreviewcedingcompanyreportsandotheravailableinformationconcerning
the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from
expectationsarerevealed.
