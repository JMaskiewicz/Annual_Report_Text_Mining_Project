Beginning in 2018, our periodic net earnings include changes in unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity
securities. These gains and losses have been very significant given the size of our holdings and the inherent volatility in securities
prices,producingextraordinaryvolatilityinourreportednetearningsfor2019and2018.Priorto2018,thechangesinunrealizedgains

Net earnings in 2017 included approximately $29.1 billion attributable to a one-time net benefit from the enactment of the Tax
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) on December 22, 2017. This benefit included approximately $29.6 billion related to a one-time
non-cashreductionofnetdeferredincometaxliabilitiesfromthereductioninthestatutoryU.S.corporateincometaxratefrom35%to

Management’sDiscussionandAnalysis (Continued)
ResultsofOperations(Continued)
After-tax earnings of our railroad business increased 5.0% in 2019 compared to 2018. Earnings in 2019 benefitted from higher
rates per car/unit, a curtailment gain related to an amendment to defined benefit retirement plans and ongoing operating cost control
initiatives, partly offset by lower freight volumes and incremental costs associated with the persistent flooding conditions and severe
winter weather in the first half of the year. All key routes impacted by flooding resumed service by the third quarter. Our railroad
business generated a 31.8% increase in after-tax earnings in 2018 compared to 2017, reflecting an increase in unit volume, higher

Earningsfromourmanufacturing,serviceandretailingbusinesseswererelativelyunchangedfrom2018.Operatingresultsofour
manufacturing, service and retailing businesses in 2019 were mixed, with several of these businesses experiencing lower earnings in
2019 from a variety of factors. Revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2019 of certain of these businesses were negatively affected by the
unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation attributable to a stronger U.S. Dollar, international trade tensions and U.S. trade
tariffs. After-tax earnings in 2018 of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 29% over 2017, due to lower
effectiveincometaxratesanda13%increaseinpre-taxearnings.
Investment and derivative gains/losses in 2019 and 2018 included significant unrealized gains and losses from market price
changes onour holdings of equity securities. After-tax unrealized gains onequitysecurities wereapproximately $53.7billion in2019

of equity and fixed maturity securities of $2.6 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2018. We believe that investment and derivative
gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally
meaningless in understanding our reported results or evaluating the economic performance of our businesses. These gains and losses
havecausedandwillcontinuetocausesignificantvolatilityinourperiodicearnings.
After-tax other earnings included equity method investment earnings of $1.0 billion in 2019, losses of $1.4 billion in 2018 and
earnings of $1.1 billion in 2017. The losses in 2018 were attributable to Kraft Heinz, partly offset by earnings from other equity
method investments. Other earnings alsoincluded foreign currency exchangerate gainsof$58million in2019,$289million in2018,
and losses of $655 million in 2017 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S. based financing
subsidiary,BerkshireHathawayFinanceCorporation(“BHFC”).

decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and
CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting

our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized as
non-operating, based on our long-held strategy of acquiring securities and holding those securities for long periods. We believe that

The timing and amount of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly
with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, weconsider pre-tax catastrophe losses inexcessof$100million from acurrent

$3.0billionin2017fromsignificantcatastropheevents.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior
years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive

BerkshireHathawayReinsuranceGroup
We offer excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks and life and health reinsurance to
insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), Berkshire Hathaway
LifeInsuranceCompanyofNebraska(“BHLN”)andGeneralReinsuranceCorporation,GeneralReinsuranceAGandGeneralReLife
Corporation (“General Re”). We also periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written
throughNICO.Inaddition,wewriteperiodicpaymentannuitycontractspredominantlythroughBHLN.
Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in
establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the
liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and
discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment. A

earned in 2019 increased $983 million (11.0%) versus 2018. The increase in premiums written reflected overall growth in U.S. and
international markets. The growth was primarily attributable to new business, net of non-renewals, and increased participations for
renewal business, partly offset by the unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar. Property/casualty
premiums written in 2018were $9.4billion, an increase of 22.0% over 2017.Theincrease wasprimarily attributable tonewbusiness

Life/health premiums earned in 2018 were $5.3 billion, an increase of $535 million (11.1%) over 2017. The increase was

lower losses from the run-off of U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by lower earnings from the run-off of variable annuity
guarantee contracts. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded pre-tax losses of $450 million from discount rate reductions and

Agreement”). At the inception of our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we record the estimated ultimate claim liabilities, and wealso
record the excess of such claim liabilities over the premiums received as a deferred charge asset. Thus, as of the inception dates of
thesecontracts,thereisnonetunderwritinggainorloss.
Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from deferred charge amortization and changes in the estimated timing and
amount of future claim payments, as well as from foreign currency gains/losses arising from the periodic remeasurement of liabilities
related to contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency remeasurement
producedpre-taxlossesof$76millionin2019,gainsof$169millionin2018andlossesof$264millionin2017.
Retroactive reinsurance contracts generated pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses of $1,189million in
2019, $947 million in 2018 and $1,066 million in 2017. Losses included deferred charge amortization of $646 million in 2019,
$611 million in 2018and $527million in 2017related to the AIGAgreement. In 2019,weincreased estimated ultimate liabilities for

Periodicpaymentannuity
Periodic payment annuity premiums earned in 2019 were $863 million, a decrease of $293 million (25.3%) compared to 2018,
while premiums earned in 2018 increased $258 million (28.7%) compared to 2017. Periodic payment annuity business is price
sensitive. The volumes written can change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the
perceivedrisksanddurationsassociatedwiththeexpectedannuitypaymentsaswellasthelevelofcompetition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion
of annuityliabilities. Underwriting results alsoinclude theeffects ofmortality andinterest rate changesandremeasurement gainsand
losses related to foreign currency denominated liabilities of certain contracts written by our U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign currency

Excludingforeigncurrencyremeasurementgainsandlosses,pre-taxunderwritinglossesfromperiodicpaymentannuitycontracts
were $509 million in 2019 compared to $433 million in 2018 and $481 million in 2017. These losses primarily derived from the
recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities, as well as the impact of mortality and interest rate changes. Discounted annuity
liabilities were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and at December 31, 2019, the weighted

Revenues from consumer products were $7.9 billion in 2019, a decrease of 0.5% compared to 2018, reflecting higher average
revenue per car/unit and volume decreases of 4.6%. The volume decreases were driven by moderated demand and the availability of
truckcapacity,aswellaslowerwestcoastimports.
Revenues from industrial products were $6.1 billion in 2019, an increase of 1.7% from 2018. The increase was attributable to
higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 3.0%. Volumes decreased primarily due to overall
softness in the industrial sector, lower sand volumes, and reduced car loadings due to the challenging weather conditions in 2019.
Strength in the energy sector, which drove higher demand for petroleum products and liquefied petroleum gas, partially offset the
decreasesinvolumes.
Revenues from agricultural products decreased 0.3% in 2019 to $4.7 billion compared to 2018. The decrease was due to lower

PCC’s revenues were $10.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $74 million (0.7%) compared to 2018. PCC experienced increased
sales in aerospace markets, which was partially offset by lower sales in the power markets compared to 2018. The increase in

PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 5.1% in 2019 compared to 2018. The earnings increase reflected increased sales of aerospace
products and higher earnings from various non-recurring items in 2019, which was partially offset by lower earnings from the power
markets due to the decrease in sales. Temporary unplanned shutdowns of certain metals facilities and metal press outages also
negatively impacted earnings in 2018. PCC continues to incur incremental costs to meet required deliveries to customers associated
with the increased aerospace demand, which negatively affected margins and earnings. The production headwinds experienced were
primarily attributable to shortages of qualified skilled labor and the rapid increase in requirements for newer, complex aerospace
products. PCC implemented certain measures and intends to implement additional measures to address these issues and improve
manufacturingefficiencies.

Marmon’s revenues were $8.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $146 million (1.8%) compared to 2018. The revenue increase
reflected the effects of business acquisitions over the past year, higher volumes in several business sectors, which were largely offset
by lower distribution volumes in the Metals Services sector, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and the impact of lower metal
prices in the Electrical and Plumbing & Refrigeration sectors. Marmon’s business acquisitions included the acquisition of the Colson
Medical companies on October 31, 2019, resulting in a new Medical sector. Marmon’s Rail & Leasing and Crane Services sectors

Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $7.3 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.3 billion (21.5%) over 2018. The
comparative increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.16 billion (26%), reflecting a net increase in units sold and

The earnings increase in 2019 reflected an increase in average gross margin rates and changes in business mix, partly offset by
increased operating expenses, the largest portion of which were employee costs. McLane continues to operate in an intensely

Revenues were approximately $50.0 billion in 2018, slightly higher than 2017, reflecting a slight increase in grocery sales (1%)
and a slight decrease in foodservice sales (1%). The decline in foodservice revenues was primarily due to a net loss of customers.

As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include provisions for reported claims, as well as claims not yet reported
and the development of reported claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.”

retroactive reinsurance), of which 84% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information

Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected
(reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the
ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We
estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to theunreported claim counts,producing anIBNRliability

Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We
generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if
appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2019, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding
company estimates by approximately $2.0 billion for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We
alsoperiodicallyconductdetailedreviewsofindividualclientclaims,whichmaycauseustoadjustourcaseestimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance ontheextrapolation ofactual historical data,lossdevelopment patterns, industry data,and
otherbenchmarksasappropriate.TheestimateoftherequiredIBNRliabilitiesalsorequiresjudgmentbyactuariesandmanagementto
reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social
and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following
categoriesorarehybridsofoneormoreofthefollowingcategories:
Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns,
together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in
the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and
coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in
unanticipatedlosses.Collectively,thesefactorsinfluenceourselectionsofexpectedcaselossemergencepatterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected
patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected
unpaidorunreportedlosses.
Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the

for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the

Additional Analysis – in some cases wehave established reinsurance claim liabilities ona contract-by-contract basis, determined

which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also
adjust deferred charge balances duetochangesintheexpected timing andultimate amountofclaim payments. Significant changesin
suchestimates mayhaveasignificant effectonunamortized deferredchargebalancesandtheamountofperiodicamortization. Based
on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2019, we currently estimate that amortization expense in 2020 will approximate
$1.2billion.

MarketRiskDisclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market
risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios and equity index put option contracts remain subject to considerable
volatility.Thefollowingsectionsaddressthesignificantmarketrisksassociatedwithourbusinessactivities.

EquityPriceRisk
Equity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that
possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each investee.
Consequently, equity investments are concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the total
fairvalueofequitysecuritieswasconcentratedinfiveissuers.
Weoftenholdourequityinvestmentsforlongperiodsandshort-termpricevolatilityhasoccurredinthepastandwilloccurinthe
future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against
short-termpricevolatility.
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts. While our ultimate liability with
respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and
expirationdate,fairvaluesofthesecontractsarealsoaffectedbychangesinotherfactorssuchasinterestrates,expecteddividendrates

option contract models cause changes in reported liabilities with respect to those contracts. Increases and decreases in interest rates
generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive
